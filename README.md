# **🌊 Ripple.NET**

**Ripple.NET** is a powerful diagnostic tool designed for ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework (EF) applications. It helps developers identify database anomalies caused by improper transaction scoping or weak isolation levels.  
Inspired by the research in the Stanford [ACIDRain paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3035918.3064037), Ripple.NET provides visibility into the "concurrency gaps" that often lead to data corruption or business logic errors.

## **Features**

* **Automatic API Tracking**: Automatically monitors all incoming API calls.
* **Data Lineage**: Tracks exactly which data points are read or modified during a request.  
* **SQL Recording**: Capture all SQL commands generated by EF in the context of specific transactions.  
* **Conflict Analysis**: Use the **Conflict Matrix** and **Abstract History Graph** to visualize where race conditions might occur.  
* **Built-in Dashboard**: Access a specialized UI at /ripple to explore collected traces.

# Limitations

Ripple.NET is currently in an early experimental phase. Please be aware of the following:

 * Interception Gaps: As the tool is in early development, it is possible for certain queries to bypass the interception logic.

 * No Raw SQL Support: Currently, we only support queries generated through the EF Core LINQ provider. Queries executed via FromSqlRaw or ExecuteSqlRaw are not tracked.

 * Provider Support: Initial focus is on Relational providers. 

## **Requirements**

* **Runtime**: .NET 10.0
* **Framework**: ASP.NET Core  
* **ORM**: Entity Framework Core

## **Installation**

Currently, Ripple.NET is in early development. To use it:

1. Clone this repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/VeloxDB/Ripple.NET.git

2. Build the project:  
   dotnet build

3. Reference the resulting Ripple.NET.dll in your target project.

## **Quick Start**

### **1\. Register Services**

Add Ripple to your dependency injection container:  
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add Ripple services  
builder.Services.AddRipple();

```

### **2\. Configure DbContext**

Enable the Ripple interceptor on your database context:  
```cs
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>  
    options.UseSqlite("Data Source=app.db")  
           .UseRipple());
```
### **3\. Enable Middleware**

Register the Ripple middleware in your request pipeline:  

```cs
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRipple();
```

### **4\. Analyze Data**

Run your application and perform some API requests. Then, navigate to:  
http:\/\/localhost:\<port\>/ripple
